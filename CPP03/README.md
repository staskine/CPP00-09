### **Module 3: Inheritance ðŸŒ³**
In this module, I delved into one of the key concepts in object-oriented programming: **Inheritance**. I learned to:
- Create **base** and **derived classes**.
- Use **constructor chaining** in inheritance.
- Apply access specifiers like `public`, `protected`, and `private`.

By the end of this module, I had a stronger understanding of how inheritance allows for code extension and reuse.

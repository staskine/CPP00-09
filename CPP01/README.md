### **Module 1: Memory Allocation, References, and Switch ðŸ§ **
In this module, I explored **memory management** and learned about some essential C++ features:
- Understanding **memory allocation** with `new` and `delete`.
- Working with **references** and **pointers** to manage memory and data.
- Using the `switch` statement to handle multiple conditions effectively.

By the end of this module, I had a better understanding of how memory is managed in C++ and how to use references and pointers.

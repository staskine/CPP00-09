### **Module 0: C++ Basics - Simple Phone Book ðŸ“±**
In this module, I started with the **basics of C++** by building a simple **phone book** application. The focus was on:
- Writing basic C++ code using `cout`, `cin`, and understanding basic data types.
- Using simple structures like arrays to store contact inFormation.

This module laid the foundation for my C++ learning journey.

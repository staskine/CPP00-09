### **Module 5: Try/Catch and Exception Handling ü™ù**  
In this module, I explored **exception handling** in C++ and learned how to write more robust and error-resistant programs. I focused on:  
- Using `try`, `catch`, and `throw` to handle exceptions.  
- Understanding different types of exceptions and how to catch them effectively.  
- Ensuring proper error handling to improve program stability and prevent crashes.

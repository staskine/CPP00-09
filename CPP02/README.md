### **Module 2: Ad-hoc Polymorphism, Overloads, and Canonical Classes ðŸ”„**
In this module, I worked with **ad-hoc polymorphism** and **function overloading**. I also learned about **canonical classes**:
- Implementing function and operator overloading.
- Writing **constructors**, **destructors**, and **copy constructors**.
- Following the **canonical form** for classes, a C++ best practice.

This module helped me write more flexible and reusable C++ code.
